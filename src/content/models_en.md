More about [modeling](https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/sjph/59/3/article-p117.xml) from prof. Janez Žibert. 

## SIR model

An adopted SIR (Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered) model of the Slovenian one, used in modeling COVID-19 dynamics, is presented. It predicts the date and the maximum value of the active cases. It is preprared by prof. Ljupčo Todorovski, Nikola Simidjievski and Matej Petković from the Jozef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana, Slovenia. 
It is a basic SIR mode, calibrated with the active cases data from the Macedonian [Treker](https://covid-19.treker.mk/). The model is calibratied regularly. All present and future results can be obtained [here](http://kt.ijs.si/~ljupco/covid-19-sir.mk/report.nb.html).

## SEIR model

The model is adopted from the Slovenian model SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered), that is used for modelling COVID-19 dynamics in Slovenia and is fully operational at the website [Sledilnik](https://covid-19.sledilnik.org/). The model was built by [prof. Janez Žibert](https://pacs.zf.uni-lj.si/janez-zibert/) from Faculty of Health Sciences and Faculty of Computer and Information Science at University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. 

This is a compartmental SEIR model extended by additional compartments for modeling the number of hospitalized, ICU and deceased people. The model is calibrated on hospitalized and death data provided by Macedonian [Treker](https://covid-19.treker.mk/). The model is calibrated daily. Further results and projections can be found on this [link](https://apps.lusy.fri.uni-lj.si/appsR/CoronaMK/) .
