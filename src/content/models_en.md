## SEIR model

The model is adopted from the Slovenian model SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered), that is used for modelling COVID-19 dynamics in Slovenia and is fully operational at the website [Sledilnik](https://covid-19.sledilnik.org/). The model was built by [prof. Janez Žibert](https://pacs.zf.uni-lj.si/janez-zibert/) from Faculty of Health Sciences and Faculty of Computer and Information Science at University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. 

This is a compartmental SEIR model extended by additional compartments for modeling the number of hospitalized, ICU and deceased people. The model is calibrated on hospitalized and death data provided by Macedonian [Treker](https://covid-19.treker.mk/). The model is calibrated daily. Further results and projections can be found on this [link](https://apps.lusy.fri.uni-lj.si/appsR/CoronaMK/) .
