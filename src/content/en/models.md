## SIR model

An adopted SIR (Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered) model of the Slovenian one, used in modeling COVID-19 dynamics, is presented. It predicts the date and the maximum value of the active cases. It is preprared  by [prof. Ljupčo Todorovski]( http://kt.ijs.si/~ljupco/),  [Nikola Simidjievski](https://simidjievskin.github.io/) and Matej Petković from the Jozef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana, Slovenia. 
It is a basic SIR mode, calibrated with the active cases data from the Macedonian [Treker](https://covid-19.treker.mk/). The model is calibratied regularly. All present and future results can be obtained [here](http://kt.ijs.si/~ljupco/covid-19-sir.mk/report.nb.html).

## SEIR model

The model is adopted from the Slovenian model SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered), that is used for modelling COVID-19 dynamics in Slovenia and is fully operational at the website [Sledilnik](https://covid-19.sledilnik.org/). The model was built by [prof. Janez Žibert](https://pacs.zf.uni-lj.si/janez-zibert/) from Faculty of Health Sciences and Faculty of Computer and Information Science at University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. 

This is a compartmental SEIR model extended by additional compartments for modeling the number of hospitalized, ICU and deceased people. The model is calibrated on hospitalized and death data provided by Macedonian [Treker](https://covid-19.treker.mk/). The model is calibrated daily. Further results and projections can be found on this [link](https://apps.lusy.fri.uni-lj.si/appsR/CoronaMK/) .
