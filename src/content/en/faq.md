<h1>Frequently Asked Questions </h1>

## TBD work in progress - some content below is  still linked to the "father" site .org 

_The purpose of the Treker project and all its statistical graphs and tables/presentations is to display all existing data about the COVID19 epidemic in North Macedonia in an understandable fashion. We've compiled some of the most frequently asked questions. The FAQ list is not exhaustive at this moment, but it is updated frequently so keep checking back. In case of any questions, please contact us: info@treker.mk. (We also look forward to your compliments, feedback, or suggestions!)_

## General Information

<details>
  <summary id=why-sledilnik>Why Treker?</summary>

Our goal is to help understand the spread of the virus and to help raise awareness, responsiveness, and the effectiveness of the measures implemented to curb the virus. You can find more about the project in the [About tab](/en/about). 

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=virus-vs-disease>What is the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19?</summary>

**SARS-CoV-2** is the abbreviation for ‘Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2’ – it is the internationally accepted name of the virus that causes the disease named **COVID-19**. The latter name is also an acronym, coined from the words COrona VIrus Disease, and 2019, the year when the disease first erupted.


</details>

<details>
  <summary id=confirmed-cases>What is the difference between ‘new cases’ and ‘confirmed cases’?
</summary>

Terminology in use on Treker is explained under [What does it mean](#chart-terminology). According to the WHO definition, a *confirmed case* is a person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. Other terms, such as newly infected, may appear in the media but are not used in our graphs. All terms used by Treker are explained in these FAQ. 

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=all-infected>Is it possible to get statistical information on all infected persons, even the asymptomatic cases?
</summary>

Unfortunately, this data is unavailable for now. There are several reasons: Previously, tests have only covered a certain proportion of the population (patients with signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection who may need hospital treatment, healthcare professionals...). Even though now the testing guidance for COVID-19 is expanded to include anyone displaying symptoms of the disease, many might be carriers with no or only mild symptoms. For this reason, our statistics can cover only part of the population that clearly shows signs of infection. Thus, the younger and the untested populations are disproportionately represented. Data for asymptomatic patients who do not show symptoms and are not recorded anywhere can therefore not be obtained.

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=other-countries>Where can I find a comparison between North Macedonia and other countries?</summary>

You can find [a comparison graph](/en/stats#countries-chart) at the very bottom of the dashboard. The graph displays a comparison between North Macedonia and different clusters of countries in relation to the *number of deaths* caused by COVID-19 *per million inhabitants*. 
The clusters of countries that are compared to North Macedonia are as follows:
-   Critical countries (EU)
-   Critical countries (global)
-   Neighboring region
-   Nordic countries
-   East Asian countries and Oceania

The graph is arranged chronologically, from January 1, from the first death, and from the first death per million, respectively. You can change the view of different chronological displays of comparisons of different clusters of countries by clicking on the appropriate tabs.

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=english-translation>Is your webpage available in English?</summary>

Currently, only the [About part](/en/about) and these FAQ are available, while the rest of the website is yet to be fully translated. However, both the text part and the source code are available as open source if you're interested in helping us translate. All the [data in the database](https://github.com/sledilnik) is already marked with English tags, so its international use (export) is also possible. 

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=are-you-paid>Are you paid for creating the dashboard (charts, tables, models)?</summary>

Not at all. Treker is a non-profit initiative created to support the ongoing compiling and editing of key data on the spread of the coronavirus in North Macedonia. Our database is public and freely available, free of charge, and non-commercial, and will remain so. Please check [How can I obtain and use your database?](#data-usage)

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=tech-used>Which tools did you use to build the website/web app?</summary>

The site is in JavaScript using Vue.js, the visualizations and graphs are made in F# using Highcharts libraries, and the project is open and available on [GitHub – Treker](https://github.com/treker-mk).

</details>

## Data

<details>
  <summary id=data-reliability>Are your data and visualizations reliable?</summary>

Data is collected from verified public sources, which are listed in the [Resources tab](/en/sources). 

Treker receives official data on COVID-19 directly from the Ministry of Health, the IJZ (Institute for Public Health), and other national health institutions. The Treker team does not guarantee the accuracy of the original data and publishes solely data obtained from official sources or the media, but we do cross-check if all data is correct and consistent with the given source.

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=data-collection>TBD How do you collect and edit the data?</summary>

[The database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ TBD) is built from the IJZ source data (by category). Data by region and age is processed with delay and is finally updated once the ongoing epidemiological demographic research results are known. The municipalities are tracked in the [TBD Kraji (Municipalities) table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ TBD).

Editing Hospital Care Data – [TBD Table Pacienti (Patients)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/):

- We receive daily reports and monitor the announcements of all COVID-19 hospitals  (TBD) – at around TBD o'clock.

- We monitor the number of hospitalizations: all wards, in ICUs, and on ventilators.

- We also record transitions (acceptance/dismissal) between individual stages of the disease (when detectable) from the obtained data.

- Where the transition (admission/dismissal) information is incomplete, the values are determined by inference (using a formula).

- All sources and conclusions are recorded as a commentary in individual cells (checkable).

- The data is compared with the summary data on hospitalized patients in ICU published by the institutions of the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia.
  
  </details>

<details>
  <summary id=data-publish-time>TBD When do you publish the data? Why are the dates on the visualizations different?
</summary>

Most data for the previous day is collected at 11:59 pm (tests, confirmed cases ...), and hospitalization data is mostly obtained by 9 am every day for all hospitals. **Our data is usually updated between 10.00 and 12.00.**
When we publish updated daily data, it is available on all our distribution channels (CSV, REST, website), and we also report it on social networks ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Covid19TrekerMK) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Covid19TrekerMK)).

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=data-differences>Several portals display numbers of infected people that are different from yours. Why?</summary>

Treker uses only validated and official data reported daily by the nstitute of Public Health (IJZ) and all hospitals in North Macedonia treating COVID-19. Our data thus comes directly from verified sources, and we have also cross-compared information from the very beginning (TBD date). Differences usually occur because different media and portals obtain the data at different times of the day or use dubious methodology. See also [Are your data and visualizations reliable?](#data-reliability) 

</details>

<!--COMENT TEMPORARRTILY

<details>
  <summary id=data-hospital-in> TBD How do you obtain data on hospital admissions?</summary>

Hospitals do not always report individual admissions or discharges from which we can obtain accurate data. The number of admissions is usually calculated from data on the currently hospitalized and from the difference compared to the previous day, to which we add the number of discharged and dead on a given day. We keep records of admissions and discharges in intensive care units and for connection and disconnection to/from ventilators in a similar way.

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=data-hospital-out>How do you obtain data on hospital discharges?</summary>

The information on the discharged from hospitals is calculated from data daily obtained directly from hospitals, i.e. from a verified source. We mostly get the daily number of discharges for all hospitals, from which we can deduce the number of newly admitted. See also [How do you obtain data on hospital admissions?](#data-hospital-in)

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=data-recovered>Why did you replace the number of *cured* with the number of *recovered* patients?</summary>

Treker used to rely on official sources (Institutions of the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia, media) for the number of cured people. North Macedonia is one of the rare countries worldwide that tests also mild cases, after 14 days from the first positive tests and treat them in same manner like discharged patients from hospitals. 


</details>

<details>
  <summary id=data-active-cases>Do you keep an Active Case counter and do you know how many people are currently infected?</summary>

Yes, these indicators have been graphically displayed as **Confirmed Cases (active)** and **Recovered (total)** from the end of April.
 

These visualizations are not data from public sources; both indicators show the calculated value on the basis of official data, so they are indicated by a dashed line for easier distinguishing. 

*Note: In some cases when the government is not reporting such cases within smaller clusters, like municipalities,  ee now consider a patient has recovered in 14 days after their infection was confirmed as per ECDC formulas of calculating recovered cases. 

Value formula:
- Recovered (total) = Confirmed cases (total) 14 days ago – Died (total) by the day of calculation

- Confirmed cases (active) = Confirmed cases (total) - Recovered (total) - Died (total)

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=data-contribute>How can users get actively involved in data gathering? How can I participate?</summary>

You can voluntarily help by collecting and verifying data from the media (as well as from the field), with statistical and other analyzes, etc. Contact us at info@treker.mk if you’d like to participate.

Treker does not collect users’ personal information nor information that individuals would like to share about their condition or hospital status.

<details>
  <summary id=data-usage>How can I obtain and use your database?</summary>

Our database is public and freely available in the form of  [**CSV**, **REST**, and **Google Sheet**](/en/datasources). Kindly let us know the purpose for which you will use the information and make sure you include Treker as the source of your data.

Since all the data in the database is already marked with English tags (see also [Is your webpage available in English?](#english-translation)), their international use (export, display) is also possible.

## About the calculations and graphs


<details>
  <summary id=chart-usage>Can I use your graphs on my website? How?</summary>

Sure! You can embed any graph or display on your site – citing the source, of course. [Click here](/en/embed) and select the graph you want to embed from the list. Please let us know about your use (info@slednik.org) and we will be happy to add your site to our collection of [recommended links](/en/links). 

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=chart-infocard-percent>What do the percentages in the infocards at the top of the webpage mean?</summary>

This is a percentage growth rate on a particular date in the number of newly confirmed cases compared to the previous day. If, for example, there were 16 people in the intensive care unit yesterday and today they accepted four more, that is 25% more than yesterday's situation.

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=metrics-comparison-chart>TBD What does the “COVID-19 Situation in North Macedonia” graph mean?
</summary>

The [graph](/en/stats#metrics-comparison-chart) shows the daily and overall dynamics of the spread of the infection from the beginning to the present. The indicators used (see [Which indicators does the “COVID-19 Situation in North Macedonia” graph include?](#chart-metrics-included)) help us understand whether and how successfully we are controlling the spread of the virus. We can monitor the daily growth rate of newly confirmed cases and indirectly see if the measures work; information on the number of hospitalizations and the proportion of those in ICU shows how many people are seriously at risk from the disease, but at the same time, this data also shows us the real burden on the health system.

The breakpoints are indicated below, on the timeline: from the first confirmed case (TBD date) to the measures (by keyword and date) taken to curb the spread and their relaxation. This helps us monitor the dynamics of the variables relative to the measures.

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=chart-metrics-included>Which indicators does the “COVID-19 Situation in North Macedonia” graph include?</summary>

[Graph](/en/stats#metrics-comparison-chart) includes:
  
* **Tests (per day)** = Number of tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus causing COVID-19 performed. In the first stages of the epidemic, this was an important indicator of the prevalence of the virus, but with the change in testing methodology, ie. of the tested sample, it turned into an indicator of the national health and diagnostics system’s capacity.

* **Tests (total)** = Sum of tests up to; data is useful in terms of comparison or in terms of the proportion of the entire population tested, but it can be misleading as certain individuals can be tested several times (eg. health professionals, retirement home employees, etc.).

* **Confirmed Cases (per day)** = Number of confirmed infected per day based on tests. This indicator does not reflect the actual dynamics of newly infected people in the population, as the tests do not sample the entire population but target the at-risk people and certain occupational groups.

* **Confirmed cases (total)** = Total number of all confirmed cases by a given day.

* **Confirmed cases (active)** = Confirmed cases (total) – Recovered (total) – Died (total)

* **Recovered (total)** = Total number of ecoveries on a given day. (#data-recovered)

* **Hospitalized (active)** = Current number of people in hospital care (either in the ordinary ward or in the ICU).

* **Hospitalized (total)** = Sum of hospital admissions by date.

* **ICU (active)** = Current number of people in ICUs (intensive care units).

* **On ventilator (active)** = Current number of persons in need of a ventilator.

* **Discharged from a hospital (daily)** = Number of discharged from hospital on that day.

* **Discharged from hospital (total)** = Sum of all discharged from a hospital up to this day.

* **Deaths (per day)** = Number of deaths due to COVID-19 on that day.

* **Deaths (total)** = Sum of all deaths to date.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary id=chart-terminology>What does it mean?
</summary>
  
Treker uses terminology which is consistent with the official directives of the WHO and ECDC (European Center for Disease Prevention and Control). We use the following tags in the displays:  
* **Confirmed cases** = This is the number of people who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Since the number of confirmed cases depends solely on testing, the number of confirmed cases is significantly lower than the actual number of infected people.

* **Hospitalized** = This is the number of confirmed cases such severe symptoms of COVID-19 that they have been admitted to hospital.

* **In ICU** = Indicates the number of hospitalized persons who are at risk of death because of the severe symptoms of COVID-19 and require placement in the intensive care unit. This is a subset of the *Hospitalized* category. 

* **On ventilator** = Indicates the number of hospitalized persons in the intensive care unit who require a ventilator to breathe. It should be a subset of the *Intensive Care* and *Hospitalized* categories.

* **Recovered** = This is the number of recovered cases. (#data-recovered)
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary id=cases-chart>What are the Closed cases and what are the Active cases?</summary>

All confirmed cases are shown in the [Confirmed Cases graph](/en/stats#cases-chart). In order to be able to monitor the epidemic, it is important to know how many are still infected. For this reason, we use the following terminology:

**Closed cases**  are the sum of all confirmed cases who are no longer infected with the virus, that is, the recovered and the deceased.

**Active cases** are all confirmed virus infections that still haven’t recovered (are still infected with the virus). See also
 [Which indicators does the “COVID-19 Situation in North Macedonia” graph include?](#chart-metrics-included)

</details>

<!--COMMENTING SOME FAQ FOR THE FIRST VERSION
<details>
  <summary id=chart-phases>What do the different phases (phases 1-N) in the graph mean?</summary>

The vertical lines divide the stages, delimited by the dates, when the authorities changed the way information about the spread of the infection was collected (the test method was changed, self-isolation interventions were introduced, bans on gathering and movement of persons, and mandatory basic protection were required).

The phases are shown because the change in testing methodology has also changed the importance of certain indicators by which the prevalence of infections can be judged.

* **Phase 1 (TBD, 2020)**: The first cases of infection in Noth Macedonia are recorded. All cases are followed, all contacts are tested.

* **Phase 2 TBD date)**: ...

* **...**: ...

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=patients-chart>TBD What does the “Hospitalizations” graph tell us?</summary>

The [graph](/en/stats#patients-chart) in the default view *All Hospitals* shows us the whole picture of hospitalizations by date arranged by the condition of patients: columns with a positive value (those above the horizontal axis) show the number admitted to hospital, the number hospitalized, shades of red are used to demark individuals in ICUs, specifically depicting how many of these are in critical condition on the ventilators. Columns with a negative value (those below the horizontal axis) show the number of discharges and deaths that day. You can also select specific hospital and see only hospitalizations there. If you select the *By Hospitals* view below, you can see the number of people in hospital care by day for each of the COVID-19 hospitals.  
The graph can offer a good insight into the workload of hospitals and can be the basis for assessing hospital capacity and planning their possible increase.

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=hcenters-chart>What does the “Healthcare Center Treatment” graph mean?</summary>

The [graph](/en/stats#hcenters-chart) shows the treatment of suspicions of COVID-19 in healthcare centers (primary health care level). You can show data for whole country or select specific region. Healthcare centers are the first entry point for taking swabs to be tested for the presence of the virus, so an increase in the number of suspicions and referrals to self-isolation may be an early indicator that new outbreaks have occurred.

The graph thus shows the number of all emergency medical visits (also for other diseases) in healthcare centers (see notes below), the number of suspected cases of COVID-19 based on the number of examinations at the COVID-19 entry point, and all suspicions of infections based on telephone conversation with suspected infected patients. Some people may be recorded several times, first by telephone and then during the examination. We also show the total number of referrals to self-isolation.


When reporting the number of tests performed, all tests (including repeated tests) are recorded. The number of positive tests therefore includes all positive tests – the same person can be tested several times and counted as positive several times. The number of tests performed may therefore be greater than the number of positive tests reported by laboratories (there, each person is recorded only once). See also [What does the “Testing” graph tell us?](#test-charts) 

</details>

END OF COMMENTS-->

<details>
  <summary id=tests-chart>What does the “Testing” graph tell us?</summary>

The [graph](/en/stats#tests-chart) shows the total number of regular tests (the *Regular* display), and the nationalsurvey tests (by selecting the *Survey* display). The columns show the number of negative and positive tests on a specific day, and the curve shows the daily percentage of positive tests.
 
</details>

<details>
  <summary id=infections-chart>What does the “Structure of Confirmed Cases” graph tell us?</summary>

The [graph](/en/stats#infections-chart)provides an insight into the daily share of confirmed cases from high-risk groups or employees in high-risk areas. Due to insufficiently accurate input data on confirmed infections, daily values (By days (average)) are shown as a moving average of 5 days. The sum of the values on a particular day, from 2 days prior, and 2 days after, is divided by 5. Therefore, the graph shows the situation three days before a specific day, and in this way we get a better idea of trends by individual groups. If we select the *Total* or *Relative* display, we will jump from the confirmed cases curve to the histogram, which shows the number of confirmed infected persons within each category on a given day.

The increase in infected healthcare workers does not mean that they were discovered exactly on that day; they may have been positive before but information on their status was obtained subsequently.

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=spread-chart>What does the “Growth of Confirmed Cases” graph mean?</summary>

The [graph](/en/stats#spread-chart) tells us how many new confirmed cases of infections there were on a given day, where the WHO and the [ECDC definition](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/case-definition-and-european-surveillance-human-infection-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov) that confirmed cases are “persons with a lab confirmation of infection with COVID19” is followed. As the number of confirmed cases still depends on testing, the data in confirmed cases is estimated to be much smaller that the actual number of infected people.
  
</details>
<!--COMMENTING SOME FAQ FOR THE FIRST VERSION
<details>
  <summary id=regions-chart>What does the “Confirmed Cases by Region” tell us?</summary>

The [graph](/en/stats#regions-chart) shows the dynamics of growth of confirmed cases by selected regions. Individual regions can be easily compared by selecting the ones you want shown on the graph by clicking on specific regions below the graph. From the curve, we can quickly see which regions have the most and which the least confirmed cases and how this number has changed over time.

</details>

<details>
  <summary id=map-chart>TBD What does the “Municipality Map” tell us?</summary>

The [map](/en/stats#map-chart) shows us the epidemiological picture of individual municipalities, as it allows the display of *Confirmed Cases* (red shades) or the *Dead* (gray shades). When showing confirmed cases, we can see which municipalities are the most "healthy" (white) and which are currently the more "infected" (red shades) – if new cases are still appearing or not - and relative to the share of the population (Proportion of population is the default display). On the left, we can use the filter (7, 14 or 21 days) to determine for what period of time we view data on new confirmed cases or deaths. For those municipalities where new cases are still being confirmed, we can conclude that the epidemic is still active. (Of course, this does not necessarily mean that the virus is not present in municipalities without new confirmed cases, but it is an indicator of the "health" of a certain area.) More details are available in the Medium article [Kje so “zdrave” občine? (Where Are the ‘Healthy’ Municipalities?)](https://medium.com/sledilnik/kje-so-zdrave-ob%C4%8Dine-613afc42b023) 

By clicking on *Absolute* in the upper right corner, we can change the display and see the total number of newly confirmed cases or deaths in a selected time frame (7, 14 or 21 days) in municipalities according to how they are painted.

</details>
END OF COMMENTS-->
<details>
  <summary id=municipalities-chart>TBD What does the chart “Cases by Municipalities” show us?</summary>

The [chart](/en/stats#municipalities-chart) shows individual municipalities in columns in more detail with the number of confirmed cases by days, with active cases, recoveries (assessment) and deaths in each municipality. Below the municipality you can find the information about the time since the last confirmed case. Municipalities are classified according to when the last confirmed case was recorded there, from which we can conclude which municipalities are currently more “infected” and which are “healthier” than others.

The display can be changed by selecting different views above the graph: if you select the *Active* display, the municipalities will be sorted according to the current assessment of active cases; or if you select *All*, then the municipalities will be arranged by the largest total number of confirmed cases. If you choose *All Regions* from the dropdown menu, then confirmed cases will be shown in the municipalities belonging to that region. You can also easily search for a municipality by entering its name in the *Find Municipality* browser.

*Note: the assessment of recoveries and active cases is done 14 days after the infection was confirmed, if and when the disease is in its mild form. However, if an individual is hospitalized, this recovery will last longer, but in this case the individual is not dangerous to the environment because he is in hospital. Since we do not take into account the hospitalized in the municipality presentation, it is possible that the sum of active cases by municipality does not match the estimate of the active cases for the whole country. See also [Do you keep an Active Case counter and do you know how many people are currently infected?](#data-active-cases)*

<!--COMMENTINT OUT
<details>
  <summary id=age-groups-chart>TBD What does the “Age Groups” graph show?</summary>

The [graph](/en/stats#age-groups-chart) shows the age structure of all confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths. The graph also displays demarcations by gender. The display shows absolute values and can be changed at the top right to the *Relative* display for a better insight into what the mortality rate from COVID-19 is relative to the general population throughout the epidemic period. In the Relative view, there are the options for different views below: by selecting *Proportion of confirmed cases*, the share of confirmed cases within a certain age group will be displayed. By selecting the *Death rate*, we will see the number of deaths per population size. By selecting *Deaths by no. of confirmed cases*, we can understand what the proportion of deaths in a particular age group was in relation to the number of confirmed cases.

Demographics can help us understand how the pandemic has spread and why it has disproportionately affected certain age groups. According to currently known data, COVID-19 is more dangerous to the elderly and those with comorbidities, and according to some data, men are more exposed. However, in order to understand all the factors, we would need to obtain more data: what the comorbidities were, the socio-economic situation of the patients, the geographical area, etc.   
*Note: Unlike other data that is published regularly for different categories, official sources obtain demographic data with a time lapse (age, municipality ...), so these are usually known with a one-day delay. This is also the reason that in the By Age Groups display, there may be some deviations from data in other displays, such as lower values of the number of confirmed cases and deaths.*
 
</details>

<details>
  <summary id=countries-chart>What does the “Comparison by Country” graph show?</summary>

The [chart](/en/stats#countries-chart) shows a comparison between North Macedonia and different groups of countries in terms of the number of deaths due to COVID-19 per million inhabitants. The graph is arranged chronologically. You can change the view of different chronological displays of comparisons of different clusters of countries by clicking on the appropriate tabs below.   

</details>
----------------- END OF COMMENT-->
<details>
  <summary id=chart-reality>Do your graphs represent the real picture?</summary>

Yes, as far as they can, given the limitations of the current displays and of the data itself: the graphs on this page only show what can be deduced from the information given. For example, the total number of tests represents the number of tests performed to date, but does not reflect the total number of people tested, as some people, such as healthcare professionals and people suspected of being infected, have been repeatedly tested.

However, the number of confirmed cases depends solely on testing. Since the majority of infected people, who have mild or no symptoms, have not been tested for COVID-19 at all, the number of confirmed cases is significantly lower than the actual number of infected people.

## About the project

<details>
  <summary id=what-is-sledilnik>What is Treker?</summary>

[Treker](/en/about) is an open-data and open-sourced project that collects, analyzes and displays some of the most useful data to better understand the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and COVID-19 disease, along with its dynamics and scope. We want to make clear graphical and statistical visualizations of what current data and reviews tell us about the spread of the virus in North Macedonia, and ensure that information on the magnitude and severity of the COVID-19 problem in North Macedonia becomes accessible and comprehensible to all.
